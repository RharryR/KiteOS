# KiteOS
A operating system/kernel focused at speed and efficiency

KiteOS still hasnt been developed enough to be usable!! Feel welcome to browse the code though!

To build, you first must set up a x86 cross compiler, heres a great tutorial: http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler

After you have built the cross compiler, you can build the kernel.

We use CMake as our build system, so make sure you have it installed. 

Simply issue 'cmake' in the root directory then 'make' to build. Enjoy :D
